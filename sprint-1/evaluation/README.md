React useEffect Basic
</h1>

Develop a React application that addresses the following requirements:
- Design and implement a user interface with a prominently displayed heading for optimal user experience.
- Create functionality to seamlessly make an API request upon loading the application and validate the received response.
- Dynamically generate and display student cards with accurate and relevant information retrieved from the API.
- Implement a toggle button to control the visibility of a timer, allowing users to alternate between displaying and hiding the timer.
- Ensure that the timer, when visible, starts from 0, updates every second, and resets to 0 when hidden, providing a consistent and reliable user interface.

### Objective :- 
- Learn to use `useEffect`. and `CleanUp function`
- Create a React application with a structured heading.
- Develop functionality to make an API request on load and validate the response.
- Display student cards containing accurate information.
- Implement a toggle button to control the visibility of a timer.
- Ensure the timer starts at 0, updates every second, and resets to 0 when hidden.

Problem Description:-
</h2>

- Landing page should have a heading `Student Management System` with `h1` tag.

#### API call on `App.jsx`

- API should get called when the landing page loads.
- On successful API calling, the student cards need to be displayed.
- Pass the array of data to the `StudentList` as a prop.

### StudentList Component

- Render div containing image,firstName Lastname, email, phone. 
- name,email,phone can be render on p tag individually after image.
- All the student cards need to have a className as `studentCard`.
- All the student cards need to be wrapped inside a container `div` with className as `student-container`.
- All the student card needs to have an profile picture, name with className `name`, email with className `email` and phone number with className `phone`.
- Student name should contain both `firstname + lastname` separated by sigle space, e.g. "Mahesh Kumar"
  
#### Timer Component
- Below the `h1` heading tag, there should be a toggle button with text `Show`.
- `On Click` the button text should changed to `Hide` and a `timer` should start.
- When clicked back on the `Hide` button, the timer should get removed and the timer value needs to be reset back to `0`.
- Everytime when the `Show` button is clicked the timer should start from 0 and it should keep increasing `(time should get updated) ` in every 1 second.
- Add a className `timerValue` to the timer component and also keep the timer value inside a `span` tag.
- The `span` tag should not contain any extra space both before and after timer value. (e.g only show the timer value)
